For the Desktop Widgets, I'm using the [Circular Widgets](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5530/circular-widgets/) extension.

# Features

- Drag and Drop Support
- Change Audio Source from the Menu (To change right/left click on Visualizer)
- Change Visualizer Size
- Increase or Decrease Bands
- Flip Visualizer Horizontally or Vertically
- Ability to Change the FPS of the Visualizer
- Ability to choose how many bands will appear on display
- Added older version Gnome Shell support, from v3.36 to v43.0

More features will be added in the future
